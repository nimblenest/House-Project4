# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the selling prices of houses using a dataset that includes various features such as living area size, lot size, number of rooms, age of the house, and other relevant characteristics. By leveraging machine learning models, specifically Random Forest Regressor, we seek to provide accurate price estimates that could be valuable for both sellers and buyers in the real estate market.

## Part 1: Data Handling, EDA, and Model Development

### Data Collection and Cleaning
- **Dataset Overview:** The dataset is sourced from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) covering house sales in and around Raleigh, NC. It represents a comprehensive compilation of house sales data, covering a wide range of properties with diverse characteristics, which provides a robust foundation for analyzing and predicting house selling prices.
  
- **Cleaning Process:** The dataset underwent thorough cleaning, including handling missing values and removing outliers based on Z-scores and IQR to ensure data quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Key Findings:** 

### Feature Engineering
- **Features Used:** Features like living area sqft, lot sqft, number of rooms, total baths, and binary features for amenities such as basements, garages, and waterfront access were utilized. County data was transformed into dummy variables to capture the location's effect on price.
- **Rationale:** These features were chosen based on their expected influence on house prices, informed by real estate market knowledge and preliminary data analysis.

### Model Development and Evaluation
- **Model Choice:** The Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle the complex non-linear relationships inherent in real estate data. Configured with 100 trees and a random state of 42 to ensure reproducibility, this model is well-suited for our prediction tasks.

#### Initial Model Performance
The initial evaluation of the Random Forest model yielded the following metrics:
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** 1,538,645.86, which measures the average of the squares of the errors between predicted and actual values. This high value indicates variability in the model's predictions.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 1,240.42, offering a more interpretable metric in the same units as the target variable. This suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual selling prices by about $1,240.
- **RÂ² (R-squared):** 0.9999, representing the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Nearly reaching 1, this indicates an exceptionally good fit of the model to the data.

These results demonstrate a strong performance, with the model accurately capturing the variance in the house selling prices.
